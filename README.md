# Recomendation Systemn (access the website on here https://holibless.pythonanywhere.com/)
* This is the development of E-commerce Recomendation system using machine learning website app base
* I implemented Machine Learning (Classification) model to give a user recomendation products based on some variables such as how many time they clicked some products, etc
* I used the **Flask** library to deploy the model as a microservice API for our end-to-end website application
* I used the **Sklearn** library to train and process our Machine Learning Model
* THe explanation about the EDA and the model can be senn on ```EDA.ipynb``` and ```Model_Exploration.ipynb```
* I used https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ as free open source hosting for my website, you can fit the website resolution by pressing ctrl- (zoom out) if the resolution is too big for you or if there is part of the website that you cannot see.
