Content-based filtering in recommender systems recommends items to users based on their previous actions or preferences. 
It analyzes item metadata to identify items with similar characteristics to those that the user has interacted with before. 
This approach examines the characteristics of the items users have expressed an interest in to recommend similar items, 
unlike collaborative filtering, which finds similarities among users. 
Content-based filtering is widely used in e-commerce, news feeds, music, and movie recommendations.
